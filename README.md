# Week 1: Report 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

This week it was a mix of going back to basics and learning things. After a year or so of not being in a studio, using CAD, or physically prototypiong, it feels good to be back. After refreshing my knowledge on Rhino, laser cutting, and 3D printing, I decided to test out the laser cutter for this first week. 

I went the simple route creating coasters for my new apartment and they turned out pretty good! I worked in Rhino and then moved onto Illustartor, where I faced some issues with having a newer version of the program. With some guidance from Cody Glen, I was able to succesfully cut my coasters. See pictures of my design below!



After cutting the coasters I felt happy to be back in a workshop, yet felt the necessity to seal them/clear coat them to make these functional... here are some pictures of the process...

Moving forward, I see myself working on very interesting projects and getting familiar with both old and new machines/tools. All the tools we are being offered and pushed to use seem to be very useful and purposeful for our future as designers. 

Additionally, I am very interested in the healthcare industry. Medical tech, wearables, everything related to it... I recently read on the news about this doctor in China who performed surgery on a patient from kilometers away. I really finds this fascinating, find the link below:
